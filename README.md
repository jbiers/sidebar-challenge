# sidebar-challenge
Creating a fully responsible and animated sidebar for the Rocketseat Discover challenge.

The layout was given as a Figma file, and the goal was to reproduce it as closely as possible using only HTML, Javascript and CSS. No major guidance was given (see the instructions [here](https://efficient-sloth-d85.notion.site/Desafio-Sidebar-f2251eb4976941eb958326ea327ffeb9#14d234339c4545fab6c5aa2fce45d8ae)), and the student was left to figure out how to make it work.

## What I've Learned:
- Boxicons platform for vector icons.
- Handling states and editing the DOM with JavaScript.
- Using CSS variables and calc() function to make the code look less arbitrary.
- Went deeper with CSS transitions to make fluid animations.

## To Learn More:
- CSS code looks messy as the program grows in size. Maybe SCSS solves this problem?
- To take the <script> tag out of the body, I think we have to put the entire program inside a "on page load" event listener.
